summary: Ansible is Simple IT Automation
description: |
  Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy. Avoid writing scripts or custom code to deploy and update your applications â€” automate in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

  Warning: This snap currently only contains ansible-playbook and is very much experimental.
